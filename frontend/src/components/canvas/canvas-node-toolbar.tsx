 * The bar over a **selected** node, and only what that *kind* of node can do (docs/decisions.md #332): a clip
 * gets interpolate, a frame grab and view, a picture gets crop/split/upscale/angle/view, a text card gets its
 * font size. What every node has — information, download, delete, duplicate, grouping — is in the right-click
 * menu, and a node with no verbs of its own (a group, an empty audio card) gets no bar at all.
 *
 * Selection, not hover: it was called the hover toolbar and appeared under the pointer (#192), and since the
 * verbs became the card's own it is drawn for the one selected card, which is also the only card whose panel can
 * be open. Hovering still means something — the card under the pointer is the one the related cards light up
 * with — but that is the board's job, not this bar's.
