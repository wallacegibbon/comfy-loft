/**
 * Hold a key, say a sentence, let go: the words come back.
 *
 * The gesture is the whole interface — `Ctrl`/`⌘` plus `'`, or a button held down with a pointer — and what
 * it produces is text handed to the caller, which puts it where the caret was. It deliberately does not know
 * where that is: this hook is about the sound, and the panel is about the draft.
 *
 * **The key.** `Ctrl + '` because a quote is what a person uses to quote speech, and because it collides with
 * nothing here: `Space` is the canvas's temporary tool, `Shift` and `Ctrl` on their own are selection and the
 * temporary tool, and the keys the canvas reads are all of the form "modifier + letter". A chord with a
 * printable in it also cannot be started by accident the way a held modifier can — and `Ctrl+'` types nothing
 * and is bound by no browser (`⌘+'` is Firefox's quick-find on macOS, which is why `Ctrl` is said first).
 *
 * **Repeat.** A modifier held down does not repeat; a printable key does, dozens of times a second, so the
 * repeats are dropped rather than treated as "press again".
 *
 * **The lost keyup.** Switching windows mid-sentence means the key comes up on a page that is not listening,
 * and a microphone that is never told to stop is the one failure worth code: the window losing focus ends the
 * recording. What no event can cover — a pointer capture that never releases, a key the window never hears come
 * up — is what the length cap is for: the recording ends itself at a minute and says so (#251). A gesture too
 * short to be speech is dropped silently rather than being reported as a broken microphone (#239).
