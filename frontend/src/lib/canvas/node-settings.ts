/**
 * The settings that decide what a node's next run produces, and the one function that turns what a caller
 * said into the fields the node's own panel writes.
 *
 * The panel knows these as rows and switches: a size in two boxes, a transparent background, a fixed seed, a
 * slider for the length, a container for a sound, the workflow's own knobs. An agent had none of them — it
 * could write a prompt and press generate, but not say how big the picture should be or how long the clip —
 * so "a 16:9 hero shot, five seconds, seed 42" was a sentence it could not act on.
 *
 * This is not a second vocabulary. Every setting is the *request's* key (`size`, `seconds`, `background`,
 * `seed`, `format`, `lyrics`, and the knobs a workflow declares), the value is checked by the functions the
 * panel and the request already use (`planImageSize`, the length bounds, the container list), and whether a
 * key means anything at all is asked of the published contract — the three-state answer #304 gave the panel's
 * rows. A setting the run would drop is refused here, with the list of what it does read, rather than written
 * into a node and silently ignored.
 *
 * What is deliberately not here: what *runs* (`model`, the Qwen `t2i`/`edit`/`inpaint`/`outpaint` mode), the
 * LoRA stack, the MOSS layout, and masks, crops and outpaints. Those decide which run this is rather than its
 * shape, and each has its own tool or its own editor (docs/decisions.md #309).
