 * offers more than one base model, and the server reports those ids because it is the side that
 * spells and resolves them (`img-zit-int8`). Everything else here is the client's own decision:
 * which media kinds are selectable, and that a disabled or unavailable workflow is left out rather
 * than offered and then refused.
 *
 * A workflow the canvas also drives from a button (interpolate, upscale, angle) is *tagged*, not
 * dropped: the node panel offers it — that is how a node can be an interpolation at all — while the
 * "default model for new nodes" setting must not, because a default has to run from a prompt.

 * itself stops there. A workflow that declares none gets no bounds and its node offers no duration control;
