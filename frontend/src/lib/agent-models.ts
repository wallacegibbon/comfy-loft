 * The editor's side of the agent's model list.

 * The list itself is AlayaCore's: `model.conf`, announced by the agent as `SM model_list` and written by
 * `:model_sync`. A canvas edits it through that command, which takes the **whole** list — so what a page
 * sends is "these models, in this order", and a model that is missing is a model that is deleted.
 *
 * What a page cannot send is the part it has never been shown: `SM model_list` carries every `api_key` in
 * cleartext; the server strips them (`agent.Model`), and puts them back into the list a canvas edited
 * before AlayaCore sees it (`agent.Sessions.ModelSync`). So an existing model travels by id and the fields
 * on this screen, and a key travels only when this page has one to give: a model being created, or one
 * whose key the user has just retyped. An empty key field says nothing and changes nothing.
 *
 * Everything else in an entry is on the form (#249): the token caps, the three reasoning blocks as the JSON
 * they are, the response field that carries reasoning text, and whether a step's tool calls run one at a
 * time. The reasoning blocks are the one place where a blank field is an answer — a form showed the value,
 * so clearing the box removes the block, which is sent as `null`.
