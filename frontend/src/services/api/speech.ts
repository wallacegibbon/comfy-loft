/**
 * Speech to text, through the server, and the list of speech servers it can be sent to.
 *
 * The page cannot call the speech server itself: it answers no CORS headers, so a request from this origin can
 * be sent and the answer can never be read — and on a phone opening the canvas over the LAN, `127.0.0.1` is the
 * phone. So the recording goes to `/api/speech/transcriptions` on the server, which is the one process that can
 * reach the address, and the address is the active profile's (`internal/server/routes_speech.go`, #239, #252).
 *
 * **The one shape this build speaks.** An OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` taking multipart
 * WAV and answering `{"text": "..."}` — a local audio.cpp server, in the default this build fills in. That shape
 * is a fact about the protocol; the address, the model name and the credential are facts about the server at
 * the other end, so they are a profile (#246).
 *
 * **What is not here: the key.** `data/settings.json` is served to every browser that loads the canvas
 * (`/config.js`), so a credential in it would be a credential for anyone who can reach the server. It is stored
 * next to its profile on the server, mode 0600, and a page can only learn whether one is there and hand over a
 * new one (#246, #252).
